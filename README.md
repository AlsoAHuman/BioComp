# BioComp
### Highly experimental and the code base is subject to change
This program takes code and compiles it to a 3D model of the biological equivalent. This compiler is based on Rust and is meant for Rust. Additionally, the architecture takes inspiration from [RISC-V architecture](https://github.com/riscv)
