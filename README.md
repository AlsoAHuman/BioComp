# BioComp
This program takes code and compiles it to a 3D model of the biological equivalent. This compiler is based on Rust and is meant for Rust. Additionally, the architecture takes inspiration from [RISC-V architecture](https://github.com/riscv). This should be viewed as a proof of concept and is not expected to be a truely functional program.
